## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Chat scoped to your Obsidian graph filter — talk to only the notes you filtered to.** Chat
  ranked the *whole vault* by similarity and fed the model the top ~6, so an off-topic note could
  outrank a real one and a relevant note past #6 never reached the model. Now you filter the graph
  in Obsidian (`#career`, `path:Career/`, keywords) and click **"Scope to graph filter"** (or type
  `/scope`): chat reads Obsidian's own `search` field back out of `.obsidian/graph.json` and
  restricts every turn — answers *and* `/plan` drafting — to exactly the notes that filter selects.
  No note outside the set is retrieved, cited, or grounded on (the whole-vault plan block is
  suppressed under a scope too, so it can't name notes outside the filter); a chip states the sandbox
  and `/scope off` clears it. A scoped turn considers up to 20 of the filtered notes (not just the
  default six), so "tell me about all of these" works without tuning `--top-k`. Precision comes from your filter, relevance ordering from the embeddings *within*
  it. By default a synced scope is **pinned** (it holds until you re-sync); a **"follow graph live"**
  checkbox (or `/scope live`) instead re-reads the filter at the start of every turn, so changing it
  in Obsidian re-scopes your very next question — opt-in, since a scope that shifts between turns can
  silently govern the chat. Empty or all-negation filters (grandplan's own default) mean no scope, so
  nothing regresses when it's unused, and the unscoped fast path (vec index) is untouched. The supported operator
  subset (`#tag`/`tag:`, `type/`, `status/`, `path:`/`file:`, `-negation`, `OR`, quoted phrases) is
  honored exactly; anything it can't mirror (`line:`, `/regex/`, `[property]`, …) is **reported**,
  never silently dropped, and matching fails open with a warning rather than emptying the
  conversation. In the same change the chat prompt was loosened from "use ONLY the notes, no outside
  knowledge" to grounded-and-smart: facts about *you* still come only from your notes, but the model
  may use its general knowledge to explain, connect, and advise — fabricating specifics *into* the
  vault stays blocked at the write boundary, not in conversation. Design in
  `docs/specs/SPEC-SCOPE.md`.
- **`gui --read-only` — browse a vault that cannot be modified.** The tray app exists to write:
  it holds a live writer, a registered global hotkey, and optionally an HTTP intake. But the thing
  you do with a *full* vault is mostly read it — chat, follow links, look at the graph — and an
  append-only log means a stray hotkey press or a mis-clicked Approve is a permanent event, not an
  undo. `--read-only` seals every vault write path for the process's lifetime. Chat, `/focus`,
  `/graph`, and clickable sources are untouched; drafts still preview (drafting only reads) with no
  way to save one. The seal is **structural** (`core/readonly.py`), not cosmetic: the repository and
  vault writer are swapped for proxies that raise `VaultIsReadOnly` on every mutator and delegate
  every reader, so a write path added later fails loudly instead of quietly eroding the guarantee.
  The hotkey listener is simply never registered — a hotkey that captures, runs the model, and *then*
  raises is worse than one that does nothing. `--read-only` refuses to coexist with `--serve`,
  `--auto-approve`, `--enrich`, or `--init` rather than silently picking a winner. Design in
  `docs/specs/SPEC-READONLY.md`.
- **Clickable sources in the tray chat — a source now opens its note in Obsidian.** The grounding
  pane showed each source's title, id, and a 400-char snippet, and the only way from there into the
  actual note was to copy the id and retype it into another command. Clicking a source title (in the
  grounding pane or on a plan proposal's "grounded in" line) now opens that note in Obsidian, where
  its local-graph pane shows the neighbourhood a terminal can't draw. Links use a private
  `grandplan-note:` scheme and the window resolves them itself: a link it didn't author yields no id
  and does nothing. A note the index knows but that has no `.md` on disk says so and names
  `rerender`, rather than opening the vault root as if nothing were wrong. `graph --open` and the
  chat now share one resolver (`obsidian_open.note_file`), so an id lands on the same file from
  either surface — including when two notes slugify to the same stem.
- **`gui --top-k N` — the tray chat can ground a turn in more than six notes.** It built its
  `ChatSession` without a `top_k`, so it silently took the library default while `--top-k` existed on
  `chat`/`ask` and was unreachable from the GUI: the same vault answered the same breadth question
  differently depending on the surface. Defaults to 6 to match `chat`; 15–20 is the useful ceiling
  (the cost is prompt-reading time before the first token, not RAM — the KV cache is sized by
  `num_ctx` regardless). `--top-k 0` is refused: it grounds every turn in no notes at all, so the
  chat looks like it works while it has quietly stopped consulting the vault.
- **`grandplan directive run` — something finally drains the directive queue.** `POST /directive`
  (your phone, via `--serve`), `grandplan directive add`, and folder-watch all append to
  `directives.jsonl`, but **nothing ever drained it** — `pending()` grew forever until an external
  MCP agent pulled it. `run` fulfils each pending directive by putting its content through the same
  structural pipeline as `grandplan organize` (organize → dedup → place → commit → extract
  entities), then marks it done. `--max N` bounds a pass, `--watch` polls; one-shot and opt-in by
  default. There is deliberately **no free-form tool-calling loop**: the local model does extraction
  and summarization, and Python does the control flow — a 7B model's multi-step tool discipline is
  unproven and isn't needed, because the playbooks decompose into steps the pipeline already runs.
  It only auto-runs playbooks it can honestly fulfil (`capture-and-file`, `profile-and-connect`);
  `extract-actions` and ad-hoc prompts stay pending for an agent, because marking a directive done
  that wasn't actually fulfilled is worse than leaving it queued. `profile-and-connect`'s closing
  "propose a next-step task" step is reported as not done rather than silently skipped. A directive
  whose pipeline fails is left pending and logged — retryable — and one bad directive never stops
  the pass. Curation stays user-directed: the pending queue is the runner's entire input (it isn't
  even given a repository, so it cannot scan the vault), and every directive in it is content you
  explicitly sent with an instruction you chose.
- **`/focus` — what to do next, in chat.** The vault already knew its own bottleneck
  (`core/schedule.critical_path`), what could run in parallel, and how far each goal had come, but
  only `grandplan report` surfaced it — so asking chat "what's the hardest thing?" retrieved six
  *semantically similar* notes and guessed. `/focus` (alias `/next`) now renders the real thing in
  `grandplan chat` and the tray chat window: the bottleneck chain in execution order, what's
  actionable now, what can run in parallel, and progress per goal. It is **pure projection — no
  model call**, so it still answers when Ollama is down or the KB model was never pulled.
  Natural-language priority questions work too: every chat turn now carries a bounded `PLAN CONTEXT`
  block (capped, with truncation stated) that is authoritative for priority/sequence while the
  retrieved notes stay authoritative for content.
- **`grandplan graph <query|id>` — find a note and see its place in the graph.** Resolves an exact
  note id, or searches semantically and shows the best match's neighborhood with the runners-up
  listed (so a wrong pick costs one re-run with an id, not a rephrase). Crucially the neighborhood is
  **bidirectional**: `VaultQuery.get_note` only ever reported *outgoing* edges, so a note could not
  see what pointed at it — an idea with a plan built on top of it looked like an orphan while
  actually being a hub. `--open` hands the note to Obsidian, where the local-graph pane does the
  depth and layout a terminal can't. Also in chat as `/graph <id>`. Read-only, no model call.
- **Live capture transparency** — the progress popup / tray tooltip now shows *what* is being
  analyzed during the longest stage: `organizing with local AI: “<first line of your capture…>”`
  instead of an opaque spinner. (The review dialog then shows the full resulting note before
  anything is saved, as before.)
- **`gui --kb-model <name>`** — choose the local model the tray chat window uses (with fallback to
  the capture model). Previously hardcoded: a user who pulled a smaller KB model could not make the
  GUI use it, so every chat turn burned a 404 and fell back.

### Changed
- **KB chat default model is now `qwen2.5:7b`** (was `qwen2.5:14b`) for `ask`, `chat`, and the tray
  chat window. The KB model is never resident alone — the capture model is already loaded — so on a
  no-GPU host the pair has to fit in RAM together, and the 14B default OOMed real machines. That
  made `--kb-model qwen2.5:7b` mandatory boilerplate on every run; the default is now the size that
  actually works. Machines with headroom can still pass `--kb-model qwen2.5:14b`.

### Fixed
- **Captured notes now build the people/org graph.** `materialize_entities` — which turns people and
  organizations named in a capture into `entity` notes joined by `involves` edges — was wired into
  `organize` and `regenerate` but **never into the capture coordinator**. Every note captured the
  primary way (hotkey, typed, or phone) therefore produced no entity nodes at all, so a
  social/network vault could not work by construction. Capture now extracts entities like the other
  paths do. The extractor follows the same model-call budget as the rest of capture: the heuristic
  one is pure Python and runs inline even under `--fast` (zero model calls — `--fast`'s
  one-call-per-capture contract is intact), while `--thorough` upgrades to `LlmEntityExtractor`.
  Only *new* notes extract — a status/edit capture creates no note to hang `involves` edges off — and
  a failing extractor degrades to "no entities", never to a lost capture.
- **GUI chat behaves like chat** — your message now appears in the transcript the instant you hit
  Send (it used to surface only once the model finished answering — a minute+ on CPU), and every
  reply stays visible in order: answers, plan/improve outcomes, apply confirmations, failures, and
  the "no local model responded" degradation (which previously made the whole turn vanish, since
  the session's model-facing memory deliberately drops failed turns). The degradation message now
  says how to check what's wrong (Ollama running? `ollama list`).
- **The `--serve` token no longer leaks into the log or the phone's browser history (#43).** The
  intake audit line logged the full request path — and the phone app's first load is
  `GET /?token=<secret>`, so the shared secret landed in plaintext in the console and the
  persistent rotating log, contradicting the line's own "never the token" contract. Query strings
  are now redacted from the audit trail (`/?token=abc` logs as `/?[redacted]`). The phone page also
  stops parking the secret in the address bar: it stashes the token in `sessionStorage` and
  rewrites the URL without the query, so browser history/autocomplete never keep it (reload still
  authenticates from the stored copy, and the share-link UX is unchanged). The Bearer-header API
  auth model itself was already sound and is untouched.

### Changed
- **Background enrichment is now opt-in (`gui --enrich`)** — the post-save LLM pass (#38: typed
  links + placement) no longer runs by default: a capture organizes inline, then the app goes
  idle. Curation is user-directed only; sustained CPU load after captures surprised in practice.
  `--thorough` (all calls inline) and `regenerate` remain the other explicit quality paths.
- **Enrichment progress is live** — each finished background-enrichment job (success or failure)
  now emits a status event, so the tray tooltip's "enriching N note(s)" count ticks down instead
  of freezing at the last capture; completions are also logged.
- **Quiet console** — the sentence-transformers `Batches` tqdm bar (one per embed call) and the
  Hugging Face Hub unauthenticated-request warning no longer spam the terminal; explicit
  `HF_*`/`TRANSFORMERS_*` env settings still win.

### Added
- **`grandplan reset -o <vault>`** — wipe a vault back to empty: deletes the Obsidian folder **and**
  grandplan's external index (notes/edges/inbox/directives, kept under `~/.grandplan/<hash>/`).
  Asks for confirmation (`--yes` skips); `--keep-originals` keeps the lossless captures so
  `regenerate` can rebuild. Guards against deleting a filesystem root or `$HOME`.
- **Progress popup is movable + dismissible** — drag it anywhere (it stops snapping back to the
  corner), hide it with the new "–" button, and toggle it from the tray menu ("Show progress popup").
  While hidden, status stays in the tray icon (tooltip + notifications).

### Changed
- **License changed from MIT to Apache 2.0** — adds an explicit patent grant; copyright holder
  (3MagicLabs) unchanged.

### Fixed
- **`organize` now persists to the queryable index** (not just the Obsidian vault), so
  `doctor`/`report`/`export`/`calendar`/`mcp` work immediately after `organize` — previously they
  reported "no index found" until a GUI capture or a regenerate. `organize_text` accepts injectable
  `repo`/`originals` (default in-memory); the CLI passes the persistent Jsonl stores. Idempotent.
- **Review dialog no longer fills the screen** on a long capture — it's capped to a fraction of the
  display and centred, with the verbatim original SCROLLING (not growing the window) so the
  Save/Discard buttons stay on-screen and clickable (the Discard wiring itself was already correct).
- **`JsonlDirectiveStore` is thread-safe** — a lock guards the append + in-memory update, closing a
  latent race when the HTTP intake (and now `up`) write directives from multiple threads.

### Added
- **`grandplan up` — one-command launcher** — starts all capture surfaces at once (HTTP directive
  intake + folder-watch on `<vault>/_inbox`) against the persistent index, directives enabled, and
  prints the `mcp --write --directives` command to connect an agent. Binds 127.0.0.1 by default
  (routable host needs `--token`); `--dry-run` prints the plan without serving. Offline.
  - **`--init`** scaffolds a fresh vault (graph-coloured config + guide + projections + a
    `.obsidian/workspace.json` that opens on the **graph** view); **`--open`** launches the vault in
    Obsidian via its `obsidian://open?path=…` URI. So `grandplan up -o ~/MyVault --init --open`
    creates a new vault, opens its graph, and starts capturing — in one command.
  - **`--hotkey`** enables global hotkey capture without the Qt GUI: select text in any app, press
    the hotkey (default `Ctrl+Alt+G`, configurable via `--hotkey-combo`), and the selection is
    organized straight into the vault (instant note, offline). Needs only the `windows` extra
    (`pynput`/`pyperclip`/`uiautomation`) — so it works where PySide6 (the tray GUI) can't install.
- **Offline polish batch (themes B/C/F/H/I):**
  - **`next`-edge sequencing (C)** — the planner now honors `next` edges as ordering constraints
    (`A --next--> B` ⇒ B depends on A), so explicit sequences shape the plan.
  - **OKR roll-ups (C)** — `schedule.roll_up_progress` rolls each goal/project's completion % from
    its descendant tasks (any depth, via `part_of`); shown in the Markdown report.
  - **Todoist-import export (B)** — `to_todoist_csv` + `grandplan export --format todoist`: open tasks
    in Todoist's CSV import-template columns (priority by lifecycle, due → DATE).
  - **`regenerate --keep-history` (I)** — replays the prior status/edit/resource/deletion events onto
    rebuilt notes whose content-addressed ids survive; reports how many were preserved vs dropped.
  - **Richer Obsidian graph (F)** — status colour groups (done/needs-review/active) take visual
    precedence over the type colours in `.obsidian/graph.json`.
  - **Folder-watch capture (H)** — `adapters/folder_watch.py` + `grandplan watch --folder DIR
    [--once]`: a dropped text/markdown file becomes an append-only directive (feeds the agent loop).
- **HTTP directive intake (theme J transport)** — `adapters/http_intake.py` + `grandplan serve`: a
  localhost HTTP endpoint (`POST /directive` with `{content, playbook?, prompt?}`) that enqueues a
  directive — the "send to my agent from my phone" transport. Pure `handle_intake` (auth/validation/
  enqueue) is gated; the socket server is the shell. Binds 127.0.0.1 by default and **refuses a
  routable host without a `--token`** (constant-time bearer check). Offline — only receives + stores.
- **Agent intake — directives + playbooks (theme J)** — `core/directive.py`: an append-only
  `Directive` (content + instruction) an AI agent pulls and fulfils, with reusable named `Playbook`
  presets (built-ins: `profile-and-connect`, `capture-and-file`, `extract-actions`). In-memory +
  JSONL stores (completion is a derived event). Exposed over MCP (`list_directives`/
  `complete_directive`, off until `grandplan mcp --directives`) and via `grandplan directive add|list`.
  The in-house spine for "send content + a prompt to my agent and let it enrich/act" — the agent uses
  the existing write/search tools; networked transport + web research are deferred opt-in connectors.
  See `SPEC-AGENT-INTAKE.md`.
- **Productivity exports (theme B, local/offline)** — `core/export.py`: `to_markdown_tasks` (an
  Obsidian-Tasks/GitHub `- [ ]` checklist with `📅 due` markers + `#tags`) and `to_csv` (one row per
  note). New `grandplan export --format tasks|csv [--out PATH]` command (zero egress).
- **Voice capture seam (offline STT, theme H / "PR-H")** — `adapters/voice.py`: a `VoiceCapturer`
  (conforms to the `Capturer` port) with an injected `Transcriber` backend, so the capture logic
  (silence → None, error → None) is gated offline. The real backend is a local Whisper model + mic
  (`pip install grandplan[voice]`), lazy/optional and fully on-device — no audio leaves the machine.
  GUI hotkey wiring deferred (Windows-only). New `voice` optional extra.
- **Critical-path + parallel-batch scheduling (theme C)** — `core/schedule.py`: `critical_path`
  (the longest chain of still-open dependency-linked tasks — the bottleneck) and `parallel_batches`
  (open tasks grouped by dependency depth — each batch runs concurrently once the prior is done).
  Pure DAG analytics over a `Plan` (skips done prerequisites and cycle notes). Surfaced in the
  Markdown report (shown only when there's a real ≥2-step chain / a parallelizable batch).
- **Markdown report renderer (knowledge → deliverable, theme E)** — `core/render.py`: a `Renderer`
  port + `MarkdownReportRenderer` composing plan + masterplan + timeline + health into one
  self-contained Markdown report (summary, top priorities, blocked, schedule, hierarchy by horizon,
  open questions, graph health). Offline, deterministic, pure. New `grandplan report -o <vault>
  [--out PATH] [--title T]` command (writes `<vault>/report.md`, or `--out -` for stdout).
- **Entity extraction + `involves` edges (agent-operable vault, step 3)** — `core/entities.py`: an
  `EntityExtractor` port + offline `HeuristicEntityExtractor` (multi-word proper nouns, org-suffixed
  names, `@handles`) + `materialize_entities`, turning people/org mentions into `entity` nodes joined
  by `involves` edges so the graph becomes a people/org graph agents can reason over. Append-only +
  idempotent (entity ids content-addressed by name); `entity` nodes are kept out of the masterplan
  roots. Exposed as the `extract_entities` agent-write tool, **and auto-extracted during
  `organize`/`regenerate`** via an Ollama-backed `LlmEntityExtractor` (unioned with the heuristic;
  heuristic-only under `--no-llm` or on any model failure).
- **Agent write tools (agent-operable vault, step 2)** — `core/write.py` `VaultWrite`: an append-only,
  offline write facade letting AI agents enrich/organize/create safely. Five operations —
  `set_status`, `record_edit`, `add_resource`, `place` (typed edge), `propose_note` — each reuses the
  existing PR-A…PR-G event ops (no stored note/original is ever mutated; current state stays derived),
  validates inputs (unknown note / bad enum / self-loop → clear error), and reports `applied=False` on
  an idempotent no-op. Exposed over MCP via `WRITE_TOOLS`/`dispatch_write` and the server's
  `tools_for`/`route` helpers; `grandplan mcp --write` opts in (read-only by default).
  `SPEC-AGENT-VAULT.md` §"Step 2".
- **PR-F trustworthy organization** — the local model is now the **default** organizer/placer for
  `organize`/`gui` (`--no-llm` opts into the offline baseline; `--llm` kept as a no-op). When the
  model is required and unreachable it **fails loud** (`OrganizerUnavailable`) with guidance instead
  of silently emitting keyword output; the verbatim capture is preserved first, so nothing is lost.
- **Diagnostics (QAS-8)** — `core/quality.py` flags un-organized notes (raw/truncated title, verbatim
  body, no tags); `core/report.py` prints a health report on every `organize`/`regenerate` (notes,
  horizons, structural-vs-semantic edges, low-quality + isolated notes, "model likely never ran").
- **`grandplan regenerate`** — rebuild a vault from its lossless inbox originals through the current
  pipeline (heuristic→LLM quality); atomic + fail-safe, backs up the old index to `index.jsonl.bak`.
- **`grandplan doctor`** — read-only health report for an existing vault.
- **PR-G relational organization (keystone)** — a placement stage (`core/placement.py` `Placer` port +
  `HeuristicPlacer`; `adapters/llm_placer.py` `LlmPlacer`) proposes structural `part_of`/`depends_on`
  edges for each new note against the existing graph, wired into the CLI and GUI capture flow. The
  masterplan/plan now get real hierarchy + dependency sequence instead of only similarity links.
  Append-only (edges only; no note mutated); offline (heuristic pure, LLM localhost-only).

- **Completed dependency model + feasible Timeline** — placement now proposes `blocks` and
  `waiting_on` edges (LLM placer) in addition to `part_of`/`depends_on`; the planner treats
  `waiting_on` as a scheduling prerequisite. New `Timeline.md` projection (and `get_timeline` MCP
  tool) orders actionable notes into a feasible schedule — **ready / waiting / scheduled-by-date /
  ⚠ conflicts** (flags a note due before its prerequisite, and dependency cycles).
- **Actionable enhancement** — the LLM organizer now ENHANCES each capture and, for actionable
  notes (task/project/goal), emits a `## Next steps` section with concrete `- [ ]` checklist items
  (RESEARCH §0 "enhance"). QAS-8 gained a check that flags an actionable note with no next-step
  checklist, so the report/doctor surface notes that aren't truly actionable.
- **Agent-operable vault (read) + local MCP server** — `core/query.py` `VaultQuery` exposes the graph
  as JSON (list/get/search notes, plan, masterplan, graph, doctor); `TOOLS`/`dispatch` define + route
  MCP tools (pure, tested). `adapters/mcp_server.py` serves them over **stdio** (`grandplan mcp -o
  <vault>`, optional `mcp` extra) so AI agents can read/distill the vault with **zero egress**.
- **Calendar connector (local, offline)** — `grandplan calendar -o <vault>` exports notes with a
  `due` date to a standards-compliant RFC 5545 `.ics` feed (`grandplan.ics`) any calendar app can
  subscribe to. Zero egress; pure/deterministic (caller-supplied timestamp). `core/calendar.py`.

### Added (earlier)
- Project planning spine: `SPEC.md` (requirements), `RESEARCH.md` (prior art / techniques / feasibility).
- Repository hygiene: README, LICENSE (MIT), `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, CONTRIBUTING, ADRs.
- CI mirroring the borromeo quality gate; Dockerfile for a reproducible core test environment.
- borromeo governance (`borromeo.toml`) — deterministic build/hygiene/format/lint/typecheck/test/security gate.
- Planning model (SPEC §11, ADR-0004/0005): one append-only graph; plans/masterplan/decks as projections;
  horizons, entities, deadlines, contexts; Reconciler (build-on/refine/supersede/contradict-flag);
  workspaces + capability plugins; multi-medium renderers — MVP slice vs deferred phases made explicit.
- Phase-0 core (offline, deterministic, gated): lossless `Original` store (byte-exact round-trip);
  `Note`/`Edge` model + ports; `HeuristicOrganizer` + `HashingEmbedder` baselines; capture pipeline
  (propose/assess/commit with approval + discard); `MarkdownVaultWriter` + JSON graph; embedding-based
  linking + dedup `Reconciler`; `Planner` → `Plan.md`.
- Runnable CLI: `python -m grandplan organize <file> -o <vault>` → vault + `graph.json` + `Plan.md`, offline.
- Local-AI adapters (optional extras `grandplan[llm]` / `grandplan[embeddings]`): `OllamaOrganizer`
  (local-LLM metadata, verbatim body, heuristic fallback) and `SentenceTransformerEmbedder` — drop-in
  behind the ports; real model calls integration-verified on Windows/Ollama.
- CLI `--llm` / `--embeddings` / `--model` flags wire the real adapters into `grandplan organize`.
- Windows selection capture: `Capturer` port + `ClipboardCapturer` (UIA-first, else clipboard
  save/Ctrl+C/restore); real backend in `grandplan[windows]`.
- Review view-model (`app.review`: start_review / approve / discard) — the UI-free, tested controller.
- PySide6 tray GUI (`app.gui.run_app`) + `grandplan gui` subcommand: hotkey → capture → review →
  Save/Discard, bound to the view-model (Qt code is a scaffold, verified on Windows).

### Added (event-sourced "git for ideas" — ADR-0008)
- **Status event substrate (PR-A, #44):** `index.jsonl` becomes a true event log — a status change
  is an appended `status` event (`set_status`/`status_of` on both repos, idempotent), current status
  is **derived** (last-write-wins), and the Planner/vault/graph all read the derived status so the
  three projections never disagree. The stored note is never mutated (lossless/append-only). Contract:
  `SPEC-PR-B`'s sibling `SPEC-PR-A.md`.
- **Capture-driven status updates (PR-B):** a capture that reports progress ("done: built the
  resume", "started the landing page", "up next …", "reopen …") is recognised as an **update** to the
  relevant existing note, not a new idea. The flow: detect update-intent → match the note by
  embedding similarity → propose the status change in the **same review dialog** → on approval append
  a `status` event and re-project — **no duplicate note, the original never mutated**, the raw capture
  still kept in the inbox. A `done` update makes the task leave "Now" and unblock its dependents.
  - `UpdateDetector` port (Strategy): deterministic `HeuristicUpdateDetector` (word-boundary cue
    matching → DONE/ACTIVE/NEXT, plus `reopen` → ACTIVE) is the offline baseline; an Ollama-backed
    `LlmUpdateDetector` (injected client, JSON-validated, **heuristic fallback** on any failure)
    judges intent under `--llm`. Wired into the tray GUI and the `CaptureCoordinator`.
  - Fail-safe + idempotent: an update is proposed only on a confident single match above threshold
    and only when it actually changes the derived status; otherwise the normal new-note flow runs.
  - Contract: `SPEC-PR-B.md`.
- **Detail edits + per-note history + "what moved" digest (PR-C):** a second event kind, **`edit`**
  (note → title/body/tags/due), so progress on the *content* of an idea is recorded — never a
  mutation. The current note is **derived** (stored note + replayed edits, with the content-addressed
  `id` held stable), and the Planner, graph, **and** the note `.md` files all read it, so the three
  projections agree. Status/edit events now carry a **timestamp** (the capture's `created`; still no
  hidden clock).
  - **Per-note history** (`history_of`, the "git log for an idea") renders as a `## History` section
    in each note; a **`## What moved`** digest of recent events leads `Plan.md`'s body.
  - **Note `.md` re-render from derived state** (`write_projections(..., originals=…)`): a PR-B "done"
    capture now also shows `status: done` in the note file, and an edit shows the new
    title/body/tags/due — finishing the PR-A/B deferred item. A title edit re-renders in place; a
    sweep removes the stale old-title file (never a foreign/hand-written one).
  - **Capture-driven edits:** an `EditDetector` port — deterministic `HeuristicEditDetector`
    (due + retitle) and an Ollama `LlmEditDetector` (heuristic fallback) — recognises edit-intent
    ("launch slipped to Q3", "rename X to Y"), matches the note on the **verbatim capture** text, and
    proposes the edit in the review dialog → on approve appends an `edit` event (no duplicate note).
    Precedence: status > edit > new note.
  - Hardening: unknown/corrupt `index.jsonl` record kinds are now logged-and-skipped on rehydrate
    instead of silently dropped; `NoteEvent.kind` is a typed `Literal`.
  - Contract: `SPEC-PR-C.md`.
- **Resource references (PR-D):** a capture's artifacts — external **links**, **images**, local
  **files**, and **placeholder** expectations ("make a resume website") — are extracted by the
  organizer (`HeuristicOrganizer` regexes + the `OllamaOrganizer`'s `resources` JSON, with a heuristic
  fallback and ref sanitization) and carried as a **creation-time field** on the note (never part of
  the content-addressed `id`). They **render natively in Obsidian**: a `## Resources` section
  (`[label](url)`, `![[image]]`/`![label](url)`, `[[file]]`, and a visible placeholder) plus a
  frontmatter `resources:` list. The index serializes them (old records load as empty). The
  `resource` *event* kind + `resources_of` + the `grandplan attach` flow are PR-E. Contract:
  `SPEC-PR-D.md`.
- **Artifact-attach flow (PR-E):** a `resource` **event** kind makes attachments first-class — a
  real artifact (file path or URL) is attached to the existing note it fulfils as an append-only
  event (`add_resource`), with the derived `resources_of(note_id)` = creation-time resources +
  attachments folded into `current_note`, so the note `.md` (and the "what moved" digest) show it.
  New **`grandplan attach <path|url> -o <vault>`** command: classifies the ref, semantic-matches the
  note it fulfils (`--describe` to guide it, `--embeddings` to match a ST-built vault), attaches, and
  re-renders. Lossless (the note is never mutated) and safe (the ref is only recorded, never fetched).
  Deferred to later: capture-driven attach in the review dialog; propagation to related notes.
  Contract: `SPEC-PR-E.md`.

### Changed (connected-vault & enhancement milestone)
- **Windows-runtime fixes:** create `<vault>/.grandplan/` on first capture (was a `FileNotFoundError`);
  the GUI fails cleanly / degrades on missing optional deps instead of crashing the tray.
- **Resolvable links (US-5):** wikilinks render as `[[<slug>-<id>|<title>]]` and notes carry
  `aliases: ["<id>"]` — no more dangling phantom nodes in the Obsidian graph.
- **Clean frontmatter (US-7):** flattened `source_app/title/uri` scalars (Obsidian renders them
  cleanly instead of a raw JSON-object string).
- **Rehydrating index (US-5):** `JsonlNoteRepository` persists notes/embeddings/edges to
  `.grandplan/index.jsonl`; the GUI reloads it on startup so captures link against the whole
  vault history, not just the current session.
- **LLM enhances the body (US-3):** the model now summarizes + organizes the body (verbatim
  original preserved in the Source block) with validate-and-retry.
- **Actionable, visual plan (US-7/US-8):** `Plan.md` embeds a Mermaid map (dependencies,
  hierarchy, semantic links); `write_projections` regenerates `Plan.md` + `graph.json` on every
  GUI save. End-to-end offline pipeline test added.

### Fixed (capture stability & observability — ADR-0006)
- **Serialized, bounded captures (no more system crash):** extracted the tray GUI's untestable
  orchestration into a Qt-free, fully unit-tested `CaptureCoordinator`. Captures now run on a single
  background worker drained from a queue capped at one pending; back-to-back hotkeys can no longer
  **re-enter the modal dialog and stack concurrent LLM/embedding pipelines** (the memory blow-up that
  could OOM an uncapped WSL2 VM and freeze the host), nor are they silently coalesced/dropped. Excess
  presses are refused with a visible "busy" notification.
- **Progress visibility (US-7):** the coordinator emits a `CaptureStatus` for every stage
  (`capturing → analyzing → awaiting review → committing → saved/discarded/failed → idle`) to the
  tray tooltip/notifications and the log — no more silent multi-second gap with no feedback.
- **Responsive UI:** all heavy work (LLM, embeddings, vault write, plan/graph re-projection) runs off
  the Qt main thread; only the review dialog and tray updates touch it.
- **Memory-safe default model:** default lowered from `qwen2.5:7b` (~5 GB) to `llama3.2:3b` (~2 GB)
  to honor the "runs on 16 GB RAM, no GPU" constraint; stronger models stay opt-in via `--model`.
- **Visible LLM fallback:** `OllamaOrganizer` now logs a WARNING when an attempt fails (was a silent
  degrade that hid a misconfigured/unreachable Ollama).
- **Faster re-projection:** `Planner` toposort uses a heap (O((V+E) log V)) instead of re-sorting the
  frontier on every pop, so regenerating the plan no longer scales poorly with vault size.
- **WSL2 memory cap** documented as a hard prerequisite (`docs/WINDOWS.md`) — the backstop against a
  runaway VM starving the host.

### Added (knowledge evolution & consistency — US-10 / #12, ADR-0007)
- **Richer reconciliation:** a new note is classified against existing notes as `builds_on` /
  `refines` / `supersedes` / `contradicts` (beyond related/duplicate). Classification is a Strategy
  behind the port — deterministic `SimilarityClassifier` baseline (default; behaviour unchanged) +
  an `LlmRelationshipClassifier` adapter (local Ollama, injected client, similarity fallback).
- **Consistency by projection (lossless preserved):** approved relationships are recorded as typed
  edges; a `supersedes` edge makes the old note drop out of the actionable plan (derived, never
  mutated); a `contradicts` is **never auto-resolved** — both notes kept, a `contradicts` edge added,
  and the new note lands as `needs-review`. `Plan.md` gains a **"⚠ Needs review"** section.
- `commit` generalized to typed `links` + an explicit `status`; the CLI/GUI review path wires through.

### Added (hardening & onboarding)
- **QAS-1 offline-egress check (was missing):** an automated test forbids any non-loopback socket
  for a full offline run and proves the guard works (negative control) — the offline guarantee is
  now verified, not just asserted in prose.
- **Vault-clobber safety:** `write_projections` never overwrites a `Plan.md`/`graph.json` it didn't
  generate — a foreign file is preserved and output is diverted to a `.grandplan` sibling (+warning),
  so pointing grandplan at a real Obsidian vault can't destroy a hand-written plan.
- **US-9 portability verified:** a test asserts the JSON graph is an open format (stdlib-parseable,
  documented node/typed-edge schema, no proprietary objects).
- **Windows onboarding:** `docs/QUICKSTART-WINDOWS.md` + a `run.bat` launcher for the daily run.

### Fixed & improved (post-stabilization polish)
- **GUI capture crash fixed (#39):** `_ReviewRequest` made identity-hashable — the worker's
  pending-review set raised `TypeError` on the first real Windows capture (a `pragma: no cover` gap).
- **Clean vault output (#40):** title-based note filenames (the content id moved to frontmatter +
  `aliases`; links resolve via the id alias, independent of the filename, and never clobber a
  different note); Obsidian-valid sanitized tags; richer frontmatter (`due`/`contexts`/`collections`).
- **Index out of the synced vault (#41):** the internal index + verbatim inbox now live under the
  user's home (per-vault, `GRANDPLAN_HOME`-overridable) with one-time non-destructive migration, so a
  OneDrive/Dropbox vault no longer syncs/conflicts grandplan's rebuildable internal state.
- **Richer connections (GUI):** under `--llm`, an `LlmRelationshipClassifier` now classifies the
  **top-k most-similar** candidates into builds_on/refines/supersedes/contradicts (two-tier with the
  cosine baseline for the tail), wired into the tray GUI — bounding LLM calls per capture.

### Notes
- The full **MVP app is structurally complete and gated** (302 tests, green gate + CI): capture →
  organize (baseline or local LLM) → review/approve → linked, de-duplicated Markdown vault → Plan.md.
- **Final step is runtime verification on Windows**: install `grandplan[windows,gui,llm,embeddings]`
  + Ollama, run `python -m grandplan gui -o my-vault --llm --embeddings`, and confirm the
  hotkey → capture → review → save flow, tuning the Qt wiring as needed.
